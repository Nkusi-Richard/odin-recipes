   <h2> Description</h2>
   <p>The tomahawk steak is essentially a bone-in ribeye steak. It is taken from the rib section, with the large rib bone still attached. Its appearance resembles that of a tomahawk ax. Having a bone-in ribeye insulates the meat while it cooks, making your meat more moist and tender. </p>
   <p> Tomahawk steaks can be found in many butcher shops and are becoming more common in higher-end grocery stores. Be sure to ask at the meat counter if you can special order one. They can also be purchased online.
